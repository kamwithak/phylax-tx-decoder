# Overview

This assessment aims to evaluate your proficiency in front-end design and programming.

## Task

Build a Single Page Application containing a nested table visualization for exploring and expanding Solidity call metadata ([docs](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/ethereum-development/transactions/ethereum-transaction-calldata)) that occurred within a single Ethereum transaction. The raw transaction data can be statically stored within a JSON file in your codebase, or you can take an input from the user and proxy requests for data. You can use any front-end framework that you like. We should be able to use `npm` scripts and/or `docker compose` to fire up the application locally.

You can use a free RPC provider like https://eth.public-rpc.com/ (Ethereum JSON-RPC docs [here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/)) and/or https://api.etherscan.io/api (Etherscan docs [here](https://docs.etherscan.io/)) to query for data retrieval.

A sample visualization:

Your response need not look exactly like this. You should take the opportunity to show off your personal styling preferences.

### Deliverables

- One well-documented front-end repository.
- Unit tests covering critical functionality.
- A brief report explaining the design decisions, trade-offs, potential optimizations, and any short-cuts taken in the name of expediency.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Correctness**: The code should work as expected, without any bugs or errors.
2. **Code Quality**: The code should be well-written, follow best practices, and adhere to coding standards and conventions (idiomatic code).
3. **Efficiency**: The code should make the best possible use of available memory and compute resources.
4. **Documentation**: The code should be well-documented, with clear explanations and examples.
5. **Testing**: The code should be effectively tested in the way you feel best represents your approach to testing.

## Submission

Please submit your assessment by providing links to your Github repositories, and add Github users `@odyslam, @con5cience, @makemake-kbo` as collaborators. It should follow usual GitOps practices, like frequent commits and branching.

## Deadline

There is no hard deadline, but the assessment should be completed in a timely manner, within a week from the day it was shared.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Good luck!
